# 🎲 Dice Roller - Google Colab Version

An interactive dice roller built with Python and designed specifically for Google Colab using `ipywidgets`. This version replaces traditional terminal input with buttons, providing a smooth experience in the notebook environment.

## 🔍 Overview

This project simulates rolling two six-sided dice. Instead of using `input()` (which doesn't work well in Colab), it uses buttons to roll the dice or stop the game. The output updates each time you click "Roll the Dice."

## 🚀 Features

- Roll two dice with a click of a button
- Simple and interactive UI using `ipywidgets`
- Clear output after each roll
- Designed for Google Colab

## 📦 Requirements

No installation required when using Google Colab — `ipywidgets` is pre-installed.

If you're running locally, install `ipywidgets` via:

```bash
pip install ipywidgets
